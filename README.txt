The overall aim of "The ASCII Project" is to develop a Unicode graphics based "Roguelike" MMORPG engine which operates a persistent world driven by a player-run economy.



GOALS
=====

	* Players can "destroy" and place blocks and items to create persistent structures, in much the same way that Minecraft allows players to work together to build constructions.

	* The game world will run and operate independent of player-input. NPC's will continue to develop and operate when nobody is logged into the server.

	* The game world will operate in a 3-Dimensional space, allowing for an "advanced" physics engine and opening the door to new possibilities.

	* NPC's will operate independent of eachother, in that each has the ability to make their own decisions based on their relationships with players and other NPC's.

	* The above mentioned relationships will continue to develop amongst NPC's without any player input.

	* TBA - I would rather be coding that writing up this readme file, please refer to the homepage at http://www.theasciiproject.com and the wiki at http://www.theasciiproject.com/wk/ for more information.



NOTES
