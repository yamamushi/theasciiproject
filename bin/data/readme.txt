The font.png file is composed of the "full" Unicode 5.1 plane 0 character set.

That is something in the neighborhood of 65,536 characters available for drawing on the screen using
libtcod. Combined with the HSV coloring format, that delivers something in the neighborhood of
~1,064,497,577,984 unique characters available for drawing with.

For the lazy, that's  "one trillion, sixty-four billion, four hundred ninety-seven million, 
five hundred seventy-seven thousand, nine hundred eighty-four" unique characters when using HSV coloring.




Files
=====

font.png                     -  This is the actual package being used in the project, it is composed of white characters
			      rendered on an alpha layer background, so you might not be able to see it properly in your
			      image viewer if you just want to see what the font set looks like.


sample_full_unicode.png      -  This is the same font as above rendered on a white background with black letters, this is
			       the file you want to open if your image viewer doesn't render it properly and you just want
			       to see what it looks like :-)






Credit
======

Producing this font would have been a real pain if it weren't for the following two projects:

The GNU Unifont Packages:
http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html

The ttf2png tool:
http://www.tdb.fi/ttf2png.shtml


Both of these are covered under the GPL, and if you're interested in Unicode at all I would
highly recommend giving the Unifoundry website a read :)
