The goal of "The ASCII Project" is to develop a Unicode-based MMORPG, based on
a persistent world driven by a player-run economy.

The interface will resemble existing rogue-like projects, such as Dwarf Fortress
and Nethack, with the heavy use of a text based interface - thus allowing for
more development time to focus on engine features without the constant overhead
of interfacing with a heavy (3D) graphics front end.

It's difficult to assign the project to a specific genre, as the "Tech" research
portion of the engine allows for the game world to move forward from a fantasy
based game into a sci-fi based game as (much) time progresses. However for the
purposes of describing the initial state of the game world, "Fantasy-Based"
will suffice.

Players will be able to form relationships with each other as well as NPCs to
establish tribes, villages, cities and perhaps even entire nations. All of this
will be driven by a server-side "Relationship Engine", allowing for evolving NPC
relationships without requiring player interaction.

The relationship "level" between characters and NPCs will be used to determine
procedural generation parameters for the evolving state of the game world. For
instance, an NPC who is enemies with a given alliance may be more willing to
assist players with an attack or may even pursue an attack on their own without
player interaction being necessary.

Originally the server-side code was planned to be closed source, however I feel
that is a poor direction for this project and everything will remain open source
and covered under the GPLv3.
