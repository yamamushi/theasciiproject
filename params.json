NPC's will continue to develop and operate when nobody is logged into the server.\r\n\r\n\t* The game world will operate in a 3-Dimensional space, allowing for an \"advanced\" physics engine and opening the door to new possibilities.\r\n\r\n\t* NPC's will operate independent of eachother, in that each has the ability to make their own decisions based on their relationships with players and other NPC's.\r\n\r\n\t* The above mentioned relationships will continue to develop amongst NPC's without any player input.\r\n    \r\n    * All C++ source code will remain 100% C++11 compliant, including 3rd party libraries. If changes are necessary to those libraries to remain standards compliant, they will be made where possible. Otherwise we will defer to another library or write our own if necessary.\r\n\r\n\t* TBA - I would rather be coding that writing up this readme file, please refer to the homepage at http://www.theasciiproject.com and the wiki at http://www.theasciiproject.com/wk/ for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n=====\r\n\r\n* Various documents of interest are located in docs/, and licenses where necessary have been included in licenses/. If you are new to this project and are just trying to figure out what this is all about, please refer to docs/ABOUT.txt\r\n\r\n* The largest online repository of information about this project can be found on our wiki at http://www.theasciiproject.com/wk/ , some of it may be dated as of the time of writing this document, however it does house the most consolidated collections of ideas and goals for this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jonathan Rumion\r\nSource code is available from:\r\n* https://github.com/yamamushi/theasciiproject\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
